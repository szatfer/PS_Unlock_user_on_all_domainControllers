The purpose of the script is to examine which user has their account locked. 
The search finds the sought-after user and unlocks the account on all domain controllers. 

**Caution: try to provide the user's name accurately because it will unlock all users with the same name.**

For example, if we only enter "Chris" as the searched user, it will unlock all users such as "Christopher, Christian, Christina, Christine, Christoph, Christa, Christy, Chrissie, Christabel, Christiana, Christos, Chrystal".
